ABOUT PROJECT -- Hello visitors, my project Advance File Manager is fully working file manager where you can sign-in and create your own folders and store your files and images in it. I have created seperate controller and service for each API (not a good practice) on purpose. Because this was my first project during my training period and I wanted to study how these things internally work. So don't mind after seeing so many controllers and services in this project. Also I have not created entities and service (Interface) in this project. I have just created controllers and service (Classes). I have created another file manager using Spring Boot + Hibernate where I have followed proper MVC structure. (Will upload it soon).

OTHER FEATURES IN PROJECT -- Have maintained session in this project and before every operation we will be checking if session is available so that no one can access the page directly through URL.

THINGS YOU NEED TO DO -- To run this project you will need your own MySQL database obviously. I have provided ER diagram of database in src/main/resource/images You can take the reference of the same.

THANKYOU -- Do not forget to add a star and follow me if you love my work ***** Your pull requests will be welcomed.
